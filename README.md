**Regulatory network reconstruction via time-lagged correlation analysis of gene expression and motif scanning data**

This repository contains the MATLAB code for reconstructing a gene regulatory network from time-series
gene expression data and transcription factor binding site motif scanning data. The code was used in
the analysis published in the 2008 article *Uncovering a macrophage transcriptional program by
integrating evidence from motif scanning and expression dynamics* [(Ramsey et al., PLOS Comput Biol., 2008)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000021).

The MATLAB code in this project was written by Stephen Ramsey [(@saramsey)](https://github.com/saramsey) except where otherwise indicated in the header comments.
